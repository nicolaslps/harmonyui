                HarmonyUI was born from years of real-world experience building Symfony applications. As a developer, I encountered the same frustrations repeatedly:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-4">
                <li>Spending countless hours recreating the same UI components for every project</li>
                <li>Struggling with complex JavaScript integrations in Symfony</li>
                <li>Dealing with inconsistent styling and behavior across applications</li>
                <li>Managing the complexity of modern frontend tooling with backend frameworks</li>
                <li>Searching for a component library that truly understands Symfony's ecosystem</li>
                <li>Companies prioritizing functionality over developer experience, leaving DX as an afterthought</li>
                <li>Accessibility never being part of the initial discussion, making it difficult to implement later</li>
                <li>Struggling to maintain a stable UI foundation without relying on frontend frameworks not natively built for Symfony</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                HarmonyUI solves these problems by providing a comprehensive, Symfony-native component library that integrates seamlessly with your existing workflow. No more reinventing the wheelâ€”focus on building your application's unique features while we provide the solid foundation you need to deliver your project successfully.
